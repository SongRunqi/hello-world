# hello-world
First use GitHub without others help.
# Some about myself
I use github since 2021 or 2020. I learned it from my order brother, but I don't really can use it beacause my poor English.
I do some post and request on it and also create some repostories use another account. But with the poor english, I can't use it well.
So I created a new account and learnd the hello-world turorail on github. I hope I can use it well and build my projects on it.
I believe this rep is just a begin.
# Introduct myself
I come from China and pround of it. China is a really good place, no wars and so on. Maybe it's a little bit difficult to learn about the world. But all of all, it was reaally great.
I was graduated from ZhengZhou Universiy of Light Industry, majored in Software and Engineering. I waste a lot of time on games during my school life. To be honestly, I think I take a bad time
of my school life. No study hard, no girl friend.It feels just like I close my eyes and next second I opend it.
Today, my english is poor either. But i feel good beacause I can speak it and write some words.It's my second language I learned. I think it was cool!
Now, I am not a student. I am a worker.It is really bad for me that so many companies don't care humnity, no anual leave and so on. Sometimes I really want to go abroad to find a company that can respect my power(may be you can understand that).
It's contradictory right?
